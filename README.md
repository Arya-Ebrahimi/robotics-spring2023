# Robotics-Spring2023
----
###### This repository contains my projects and homeworks for the Robotics-Spring2023 course at the Ferdowsi University of Mashhad.

1. Introduction to ROS2
	- [**Assignment1**](assignments/assignment1/) -> `Multi Language Publisher Subscriber` Two nodes which are communicating with topics. Subscriber is developed using Python, and the publisher is programmed in C++. 

	- [ **Lab1**](labs/lab1/) -> `Turtle Chaser`.

	- [ **Assignment2**](assignments/assignment2/) -> `Yin&Yang` Two packages, one in python and one in C++ that are communicating with each other using ROS2 services and actions.

	- [**Lab2**](labs/lab2/) -> `Turtlesim Controller` 
2. Introduction to TF2
	- [**Assignment3**](assignments/assignment3/) -> `Trutlemania` Turtles chasing each other using tf2 transforms.
  
3. Motion Planning using Moveit2
	- [**Lab4**](labs/lab4/) -> `Hello Moveit` Motion planning using moveit, rviz and gazebo using Panda manipulator.
	- [**Lab5**](labs/lab4/) -> `FUMTI` motion planning using moveit, rviz and gazebo using FUMTI manipulator.

4. Gazebo Intro
   - [**Lab3**](labs/lab3/) -> `GZ Intro`
   - [**Assignment5**](assignments/assignment5/) -> `RGB NAV` Gazebo installation guide is at the first of this assignment.

5. Mobile Robots
	- [**Lab7**](labs/lab7/) -> `Simple Differential Drive` Simple diff drive, forward and backward Twist published using ros2 topic and converted to gz topic using ros_gz_bridge.
	
	- [**Lab8**](labs/lab8/) -> `Maze` Previous diff-drive in a maze, using LIDAR sensor to detect walls and preventing the collision.

    - [**Lab9**](labs/lab9/) -> `Maze2` 
	
	- [**Assignment5**](assignments/assignment5/) -> `RGB NAV` Navigate eddiebot in a maze using RGB signs. first clone and build [eddiebot-ros](https://github.com/arashsm79/eddiebot-ros).
	
	- [**Assignment6**](assignments/assignment6/) -> `Eddie Kinect Laserscan` Convert kinect depth image to LaserScan using [depthimage_to_laserscan](https://github.com/ros-perception/depthimage_to_laserscan).
